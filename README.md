## What is CueStep Fader?
CueStep Fader is a Lua plugin for GrandMA2 lighting consoles and its goal is to make cue-step fader usable for everyone!
With CSF you can trigger specific cues in a sequence depending on the faderposition. For example if you have a 10 channel sunstrip and want to control how many lamps are glowing by moving the fader up and down. And the best: It doesn't require any in-depth knowlege of the console and sets up everything in seconds and nearly completely automatically!
